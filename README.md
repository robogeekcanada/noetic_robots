# noetic_robots

A collection of tutorials on how to rescue robot simulations that are old but goodies to make them work in **[ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic)**.
The tutorials have been tested in **Linux** and **WSL**. Currently contributing to [RoboStack](https://github.com/RoboStack/ros-noetic) team to make them work in Windows but it will be a while and when ready I will create a separate repo.

1. TIAGo Simulation
2. TIAGo Tutorials
3. PR2 Simulation
4. Husky Simulation (**official version now available**)
5. STDR Simulation
6. Copernicus Simulation
7. TALOS Simulation
8. Thormang3 Simulation
9. Baxter Simulation
10. Sciurus17 Simulation (**official version now available**)
11. Nao robot Simulation
12. Robonaut 2 Simulation (**ROS Noetic version available from TracLabs**)
13. Turtlebot (**Progress Report now available**)
14. Pepper robot (Progress Report coming soon) 
15. BipedRobin Simulation (Research/Planning stage)
16. HiroNXO Simulation (Research/Planning stage) 

More to come so stay tuned. If you would like me to work on a particular robot, please send me a request and I will work on it on my spare time. I list the robot simulations that are work in progress. It usually takes me 2-5 days to get them working. It all depends on my time availability and complexity. If you would like to contribute, that's also very welcome, send me a message to osilva@robogeekcanada.com and we can figure out how.

# Assumptions when using these Tutorials:

1. You are not new to ROS, have a bit of experience with building packages and know how to launch nodes.
2. Tutorials have been tested in Ubuntu 20.04 and WSL Ubuntu 20.04 only
3. You have some basic knowledge of OpenCV, C++ and Python.
4. You have a few hours to work on this. 

The goal is to make the minimum amount of changes to the original package as possible. These are not intended to be the official ROS Noetic packages, that's why I kept it as tutorials and will share files only when it's absolutely necessary. I personally enjoy the process of troubleshooting these upgrades. I try to stay discipline and document my steps as best as possible. Thank you for taking the time to visit this repo. This is a small way for me to give back to Open Source community.
