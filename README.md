# noetic_robots

A collection of tutorials on how to rescue robot simulations that are old but goodies work in **ROS Noetic**.
The tutorials have been tested in **Linux** and **WSL**. Currently working with RoboStack team to make them work in Windows but it will be a while and I will create a different repo.

1. TIAGo Simulation
2. TIAGo Tutorials
3. PR2 Simulation
4. Husky Simulation
5. STDR Simulation
6. Robonaut 2 Simulation (Work in Progress)
7. Baxter Simulation (work in Progress)

More to come, stay tuned. Or send me a request and I will work on it on my spare time. If you would like to contribute, that's also very welcome, send me a message and we can figure out how.
