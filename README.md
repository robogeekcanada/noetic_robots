# noetic_robots

A collection of tutorials to make robots that are oldies but goodies work in **ROS Noetic**.
The tutorials have been tested in **Linux** and **WSL**. Currently working with RoboStack team to make them work in Windows but it will be a while and I will create a different repo.

1. TIAGo Simulation
2. TIAGo Tutorials
3. PR2 Simulation
4. Husky Simulation (Coming soon)

More to come, stay tuned. Or send me a request and I will work on it on my spare time.
