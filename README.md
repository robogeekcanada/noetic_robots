# noetic_robots

A collection of tutorials on how to rescue robot simulations that are old but goodies to make them work in **[ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic)**.
The tutorials have been tested in **Linux** and **WSL**. Currently contributing to [RoboStack](https://github.com/RoboStack/ros-noetic) team to make them work in Windows but it will be a while and when ready I will create a separate repo.

1. TIAGo Simulation
2. TIAGo Tutorials
3. PR2 Simulation
4. Husky Simulation
5. STDR Simulation
6. Robonaut 2 Simulation (Work in Progress)
7. Baxter Simulation (work in Progress)

More to come so stay tuned. If you would like me to work on a particular robot, please send me a request and I will work on it on my spare time. I list the robot simulations that are work in progress. It usually takes me 2-5 days to get them working. It all depends on my time availability and complexity. If you would like to contribute, that's also very welcome, send me a message to osilva@robogeekcanada.com and we can figure out how.
